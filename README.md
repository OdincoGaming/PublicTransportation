A game inspired by the horror of the New York City Subway. 
You're at your stop but the doors are far away and fast closing, yet nobody is getting out of your way.
The maze generation is based off of Conway's Game of Life where each cell in the maze has it's own set of rules that determine if it is a walkway or not.
I used MakeHuman for the characters. 
I plan to add more elements like sounds; to increase the creepy factor, 
as well as more animations and a dynamic moving crowd outside the subway cars to increase immersion.
