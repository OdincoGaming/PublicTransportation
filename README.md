A game meant to evoke the horror of the New York City subway system.
The maze generation is based off of Conway's Game of Life where each cell in the maze has it's own set of rules that determine if it is a walkway or not.
I used MakeHuman for the characters. 
I plan to add more elements like sounds; to increase the creepy factor, 
as well as more animations and a dynamic moving crowd outside the subway cars to increase immersion.
